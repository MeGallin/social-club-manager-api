## [BE-7, BE-8 Supplement] Assign Club Creator as Owner/Admin

### Goal

Ensure that when a new club is created, the authenticated user is automatically and securely set as the club's owner/primary admin.  
Support both the ownership field (`creator_id` in `public.clubs`) and prepare for future flexible role assignments in a club members table (`public.club_members`).

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- Upon successful creation of a club via the API, the creating user's UUID is stored as `creator_id` in the `public.clubs` table.
- (Optional/Recommended) The system also inserts a record in `public.club_members` with the role `"owner"` or `"admin"` for the creating user and new club.
- All logic is atomic and transactional—club creation and admin assignment succeed or fail together.
- Only the club creator can perform sensitive actions (update/delete) on their club by default (enforced by RLS and API).
- Manual tests confirm the creator is correctly linked as owner/admin.

---

### Tasks

1. **Assign `creator_id` on Club Creation**

   - In the club creation endpoint (see [BE-7], [BE-8]), set `creator_id` to the authenticated user’s UUID (from JWT).
   - Ensure Supabase insert always includes this field.
   - Add or update RLS to enforce permissions for this user.

2. **Insert Owner/Admin Role in `club_members` Table (For Future Multi-Admin Support)**

   - (If not already present) create `public.club_members` table:
     ```sql
     create table public.club_members (
       club_id uuid references public.clubs(id) on delete cascade,
       user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
       role text not null, -- e.g., 'owner', 'admin', 'member'
       joined_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()),
       primary key (club_id, user_id)
     );
     ```
   - On club creation, insert a row into `public.club_members`:
     - `club_id`: the new club’s id
     - `user_id`: creator's UUID
     - `role`: `'owner'`
   - Make this step part of the onboarding API (see [BE-8]).

3. **Transactional Logic (Backend)**

   - Use Supabase client with transaction or handle sequential insert error handling (if available in your language/SDK).
   - If either the club or club member insert fails, rollback or surface error.

4. **Enforce Permissions via RLS and API**

   - RLS on `public.clubs` ensures only the `creator_id` can update/delete.
   - RLS on `public.club_members` allows users to view their roles and only owner/admins to manage roles.

5. **Manual Testing**
   - Create a club and check `creator_id` in `public.clubs`.
   - Confirm a row with role `'owner'` exists in `public.club_members`.
   - Attempt update/delete as non-creator to ensure forbidden.
   - Confirm only `'owner'` can perform admin actions.

### How to Test in Postman

#### **1. Club Creation/Onboarding**

- **POST /api/clubs** or **POST /api/onboarding/club**
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Chess Club",
    "type": "hobby",
    "enabled_modules": ["events"]
  }
  ```

#### **2. Verify Creator Assignment**

Check the `public.clubs` table for `creator_id`:

```sql
SELECT id, name, creator_id FROM public.clubs WHERE name = 'Chess Club';
```

#### **3. Verify Owner Role in club_members**

Check the `public.club_members` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.club_members WHERE role = 'owner';
```

#### **4. Test New Membership Endpoints**

- **GET /api/clubs/:id/members** - Get club members list
- **GET /api/clubs/:id/membership** - Get user's membership status
