## [BE-12] Support Modular Onboarding Checklist & Service Pattern

### Goal

Support a guided onboarding experience for new club admins and members by exposing onboarding checklist status via the API and providing modular support for onboarding steps.  
Enable the frontend to display a dynamic, guided dashboard tour/checklist based on user and club state.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- Each club/user profile tracks completion of key onboarding steps (e.g., created club, enabled modules, invited first member, created first event).
- API endpoint(s) expose onboarding checklist state for the current user/club.
- Onboarding status is updatable as each step is completed (e.g., via specific endpoints or as part of club/member/event creation).
- Checklist steps are extensible (modular), supporting future onboarding items (e.g., connect payments, upload logo, customize roles).
- Service pattern in the backend is modular to allow easy addition of onboarding steps/checks.
- Manual tests in Postman confirm onboarding status can be retrieved and updated.
- Frontend can use this API to present a tailored onboarding experience (guided tour, checklist, completion percentage).

### Tasks

1. **Schema Update (Optional/Recommended)**

   - Add an `onboarding_status` JSONB field to `public.clubs` (for club onboarding) or `public.profiles` (for user onboarding).
     ```sql
     alter table public.clubs add column if not exists onboarding_status jsonb default '{}';
     ```
   - Example value:
     ```json
     {
       "created_club": true,
       "enabled_modules": ["events", "payments"],
       "invited_member": false,
       "created_event": false
     }
     ```

2. **Onboarding Status API**

   - **Route:** `GET /api/onboarding/status`
   - **Returns:** onboarding_status object for current club/user (e.g., as attached to club or profile).
   - **Requires:** Authenticated user, club context (via query param or userâ€™s primary club).
   - **Example Response:**
     ```json
     {
       "created_club": true,
       "enabled_modules": ["events", "payments"],
       "invited_member": false,
       "created_event": false
     }
     ```

3. **Update Onboarding Step API**

   - **Route:** `PATCH /api/onboarding/status`
   - **Input:** `{ step: "invited_member", value: true }`
   - **Action:** Updates onboarding_status JSON for club/profile.
   - **Auto-update:** API endpoints for club, invite, event creation should auto-mark their respective steps as complete (e.g., after POST /clubs, set "created_club": true).
   - **Requires:** Authenticated user, proper club context.

4. **Backend Modular Service Pattern**

   - Design onboarding logic as modular service/functions, so steps/checks can be easily added in the future (see [BE-12]).
   - Each onboarding-related API (club creation, member invite, event creation) triggers onboarding status update if relevant.

5. **Testing in Postman**

   - Retrieve onboarding status (should match club/user progress).
   - Update onboarding status via PATCH.
   - Trigger onboarding updates indirectly by completing actions (e.g., invite member, create event).

6. **Document Usage**
   - Add API usage and sample checklist logic to backend docs/README.

### How to Test in Postman

#### 1. Get Onboarding Status

- **GET /api/onboarding/status?club_id=<club-uuid>**
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`
- **Expected Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "created_club": true,
    "enabled_modules": ["events", "payments"],
    "invited_member": false,
    "created_event": false
  }
  ```
