## [BE-9, BE-10] Invite Other Members/Co-Admins

### Goal

Allow club admins/owners to add members and co-admins to a club by inviting users via email or generating secure invite codes.  
Establish a `public.club_members` table in Supabase to track club membership, roles, and invitation status.

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- `public.club_members` table exists with fields for `club_id`, `user_id` (nullable until accepted), `email`, `role`, `invite_status`, `invite_code`, and `joined_at`.
- API endpoint for admins to:
  - Invite new users by email (sends invite, sets status to "pending").
  - Generate single-use invite codes for role-based joining (status "pending" until accepted).
- Only club owners/admins can invite or generate codes for their club.
- When an invited user signs up or accepts an invite code:
  - Their Supabase `user_id` is attached to the club member record.
  - Status updates to "active".
  - Role assignment is respected.
- All flows validated and documented.
- Endpoints testable via Postman for both flows.

### Tasks

1. **Design/Extend `public.club_members` Table**

   ```sql
   create table public.club_members (
     club_id uuid references public.clubs(id) on delete cascade,
     user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade, -- nullable for pending invites
     email text,
     role text not null, -- 'admin', 'member', etc.
     invite_status text not null default 'pending', -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'active'
     invite_code text, -- unique, single-use
     joined_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()),
     primary key (club_id, coalesce(user_id, email, invite_code))
   );
   ```
